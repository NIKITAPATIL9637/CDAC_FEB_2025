1) Write a query that will give you all orders for more than Rs. 1,000.
---> SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE amount > 1000;

2) Write a query that will give you the names and cities of all salespeople in London with a commission above .10.
----> SELECT sname, city FROM Salespeople WHERE city = 'London' AND comm > 0.10;

3) Write a query on the Customers table whose output will exclude all customers with a rating <= 100, unless they are located in Rome.
----> SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE rating > 100 OR city = 'Rome';

4) What will be the output from the following query?
Select * from Orders
where (amt < 1000 OR
NOT (odate = ‘1990-10-03’
AND cnum > 2003));
----> This query returns most orders, and it only excludes rows where: amt >= 1000 AND, odate = '1990-10-03' AND, cnum > 2003.

5) What will be the output of the following query?
Select * from Orders
where NOT ((odate = ‘1990-10-03’ OR snum
>1006) AND amt >= 1500);
----> It satisfies either odate = '1990-10-03' or snum > 1006, and the amt >= 1500 The amount is greater than or equal to 1500.

6) What is a simpler way to write this query?
Select snum, sname, city, comm From Salespeople where (comm > .12 OR comm <.14);
----> SELECT snum, sname, city, comm FROM Salespeople WHERE comm > 0.12 AND comm < 0.14;
